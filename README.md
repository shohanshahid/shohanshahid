Eliminating black box risk in outsourced software delivery through governance led systems, clear handoffs, visible QA, and weekly reporting.

## What I do
I help founders, CTOs, and agency owners convert unclear delivery into an execution plan stakeholders can defend, then run pod execution with visible QA and clean handoffs.

## Commercial entry point
Paid Diagnostic Sprint, 5,000 USD, 5 to 7 working days

Outputs
1. Architecture and integration map  
2. Prioritized backlog with effort bands  
3. Risk register  
4. Delivery plan and decision triggers  

## How delivery runs after the diagnostic
Pod execution via white label, co build, or staff augmentation with:
1. Definition of done and QA visibility  
2. Weekly reporting and decision log  
3. Clean handoffs and release readiness checks  

## Proof templates on this GitHub
Sanitized templates used in delivery governance work:
1. Weekly reporting format  
2. Risk register structure  
3. Definition of done and release readiness gates
